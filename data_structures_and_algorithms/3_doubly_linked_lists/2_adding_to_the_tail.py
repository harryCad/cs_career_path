Adding to the Tail
Since doubly linked lists have a tail property, we don’t have to iterate through the entire list to add to the tail like we did with a singly linked list. The new method will mirror what we did in our .add_to_head() method:

Start by checking to see if there is a current tail to the list
If there is (meaning the list is not empty), then we want to reset the pointers at the tail of the list:
Set the current tail’s next node to the new tail
Set the new tail’s previous node to the current tail
Update the tail property to be the new tail
Finally, if there isn’t a current head to the list (meaning the list was empty):
Update the head property to be the new tail since that node will be both the head and tail
Instructions
1.
Define an .add_to_tail() method that takes self and new_value as parameters.

Inside, create:

A new_tail Node that takes new_value as a parameter
A current_tail Node that’s set to the list’s tail
Checkpoint 2 Passed
2.
If there is a current tail to the list:

Set the current tail’s next node to new_tail
Set new_tail‘s previous node to the current tail
Checkpoint 3 Passed

3.
Outside your if statement, set the list’s tail to the new_tail.

Checkpoint 4 Passed
4.
Lastly, if the list doesn’t have a head, set the list’s head to the new tail.
